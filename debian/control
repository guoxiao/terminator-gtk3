Description: Multiple GNOME terminals in one window
 This is a project to produce an efficient way of filling a 
 large area of screen space with terminals. This is done by 
 splitting the window into a resizeable grid of terminals. As 
 such, you can  produce a very flexible arrangements of terminals 
 for different tasks.
