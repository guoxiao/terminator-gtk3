    after extensive user feedback. Added context menu icons to try and
    make the meaning clearer.
  * Added keybindings for terms size and scrollbar manipulation. Thanks 
    Emmanuel Bretelle.
  * Completely revamped config system which now transparently makes use
    of gconf settings if they are available, falls back to sensible
    defaults if not, and can be overridden entirely by ~/.config/terminator/config
  * Support terminal zooming - now you can quickly hide all terminals apart
    from one and either scale the fontsize or not.
  * New application icon from Cory Kontros

  * Watch the system monospace font setting. Closes LP #197960

terminator 0.8.1:
  * Fixed ChangeLog
  * Revert URI matching behaviour to the same as gnome-terminal
  * Close LP #179315 with a fuller fix that provides proper colour support

terminator 0.8:
  * Make dependency on python-gnome optional. Non-gnome users can now reap
    the glorious benefits of Terminator and will only lose the ability to
    open email URLs (assuming their browser won't handle this for them).
    Closes LP #184809
  * Remove blank translations from .desktop file to fix empty menu entries.
    Closes LP #187187

terminator 0.7:

  * Fullscreen support, via a patch from Thomas Meire. Closes LP #178914
  * Improved behaviour when closing terminals/window. Result of work by 
    Thomas Meire. Closes LP #161121
  * Freedesktop .desktop file and appropriate setup.py entry for 
    installing it. Closes LP #178943
  * Translation support, with Spanish, Dutch, Italian and Romanian 
    translations. Closes LP #161120
  * Stop clashing with gnome-terminal's paste shortcut key, move 
    horizontal splitting shortcut too, and add support for 
    gnome-terminal's copy/paste shortcuts. Closes LP #179310
  * Borderless support (tell your window manager not to decorate 
    Terminator)
  * Font zooming support. Closes LP #178792

    reverted if it is annoying

    Closes LP #179315

  * Use new gnome-terminal gconf key to find available profiles
  * Move a few more hardcoded items to our settings array (not that 
    it can be overridden yet)
  * Fix handling of exiting child processes to properly track 
    gnome-terminal settings
  * Add Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab as options for switching terminals 
    (patch from Kees Cook)
  * Stop using parent.show_all() when removing/adding a terminal and 
    instead show the actual widgets that have been created. This 
    prevents scrollbars from re-appearing after they have been hidden

terminator 0.5:

  * The terminator window is now able to resize smaller, 
    thanks to Kees Cook for the fix.
  * Email addresses are now matched and opened correctly. 
    Closes LP #139015
  * Double clicking a URL now selects the whole URL. Closes LP #129533
  * The default behaviour is now to open a single 80x24 terminal rather
    than four terminals in a maximised window. Closes LP #126219 and
    should force me to fix LP #87720
  * There are now hotkeys for switching between terminals, splitting 
    terminals and closing them. Closes LP #149931 and #148622(thanks 
    to Huanghe for patches for this)
  * If there is only one terminal, closing it will not produce a quit 
    message

  * Fix section
  * Add AUTHORS file
  * Rename script to drop the .py
  * Handle the gnome-terminal profile better by offering command options

    (if any)

    bash (or at least zsh)
