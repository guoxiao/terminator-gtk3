terminator 0.9:
	* Added support for ~/.terminatorrc 
	* Added kwybindings for terms size and scrollbar manipulation. Thanks 
	  Emmanuel Bretelle.


terminator 0.8.1:
	* Fixed ChangeLog
	* Revert URI matching behaviour to the same as gnome-terminal

terminator 0.8:
	* Make dependency on python-gnome optional. Non-gnome users can now reap
	  the glorious benefits of Terminator and will only lose the ability to
	  open email URLs (assuming their browser won't handle this for them).
	  Closes LP #184809
	* Remove blank translations from .desktop file to fix empty menu entries
	  Closes LP #187187
	* Add application icon at various sizes including a window icon
	* New options parser allowing -x support. Closes LP191124
	* More translations (thanks!)

terminator 0.7:

	* Fullscreen support, via a patch from Thomas Meire. Closes LP #178914
	* Improved behaviour when closing terminals/window. Result of work by 
	  Thomas Meire. Closes LP #161121
	* Freedesktop .desktop file and appropriate setup.py entry for 
	  installing it. Closes LP #178943
	* Translation support, with Spanish, Dutch, Italian and Romanian 
	  translations. Closes LP #161120
	* Stop clashing with gnome-terminal's paste shortcut key, move 
	  horizontal splitting shortcut too, and add support for 
	  gnome-terminal's copy/paste shortcuts. Closes LP #179310
	* Borderless support (tell your window manager not to decorate 
	  Terminator)
	* Font zooming support. Closes LP #178792
	* Set the VTE widget to have a tooltip of its window title. This may be
	  reverted if it is annoying
	* Support GNOME Terminal profile settings for backgrounds. 
	  Closes LP #180717
	* Use our own default values if there is no gnome-terminal profile. 
	  Closes LP #179315

terminator 0.6:

	* Use new gnome-terminal gconf key to find available profiles
	* Move a few more hardcoded items to our settings array (not that 
	  it can be overridden yet)
	* Fix handling of exiting child processes to properly track 
	  gnome-terminal settings
	* Add Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab as options for switching terminals 
	  (patch from Kees Cook)
	* Stop using parent.show_all() when removing/adding a terminal and 
	  instead show the actual widgets that have been created. This 
	  prevents scrollbars from re-appearing after they have been hidden

terminator 0.5:

	* The terminator window is now able to resize smaller, 
	  thanks to Kees Cook for the fix.
	* Email addresses are now matched and opened correctly. 
	  Closes LP #139015
	* Double clicking a URL now selects the whole URL. Closes LP #129533
	* The default behaviour is now to open a single 80x24 terminal rather
	  than four terminals in a maximised window. Closes LP #126219 and
	  should force me to fix LP #87720
	* There are now hotkeys for switching between terminals, splitting 
	  terminals and closing them. Closes LP #149931 and #148622(thanks 
	  to Huanghe for patches for this)
	* If there is only one terminal, closing it will not produce a quit 
	  message

terminator 0.4:

	* Architecture should be all, not any
	* Fix section
	* Add AUTHORS file
	* Rename script to drop the .py
	* Handle the gnome-terminal profile better by offering command options
	* Fudge around some resizing issues
	* Fix child spawning to avoid segfaulting zsh
	* Misc. code formatting/style improvements
	* Refactor terminal splitting into one axis agnostic function
	* Flesh out setup.py a tiny bit more

terminator 0.3:

	* Implemented terminal closing, which correctly reparents its sibling
	  (if any)
	* Updated documentation to reflect a serious bug with shells that aren't
	  bash (or at least zsh)

terminator 0.2:

	* Support dynamically splitting terminals

terminator 0.1:

	* Fixed some distribution wording
	* Fix build-depends
	* Initial release
